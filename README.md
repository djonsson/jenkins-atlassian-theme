# Jenkins Atlassian Theme

<img src="http://danieljonsson.net/jenkins_beard.png" alt="" />

So you want Bamboo but you can´t afford it? Well, you´re in luck! Introducing **Jenkins Atlassian Theme** - Bamboo for the poor. It's the perfect middle ground - not Bamboo, but looks like it could be! 

In just *seven* easy steps this camouflage will make Jenkins look just like a product from Atlassian and blend in with the rest of your Atlassian development environment like Stash, Jira and Confluence. 

*The project is not affiliated or endorsed by Atlassian*
